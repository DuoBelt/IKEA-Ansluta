IKEA *Ansluta* 433â€¯MHz remote on/off switch reverse engineering

This is my humble attempt at analyzing and replicating the transmissions of the IKEA *Ansluta* remote on/off switch. (Note: There are at least two different versions of this remote; this is about the simple switch without dimming.)

The plan:
 - find transmitter on the PCB
 - capture `on`/`off` transmissions at the source
 - figure out the code (optional)
 - replicate the code with own transmitter
